Description

  This repository is focused on using OpenCV for eyetracking research.The main goal is to accurately track the position of the eyes and head,<br>
  and convert that information into a position on a screen.  The software is still under development, but has shown promising results so far.<br>
  I have the intention to convert this layout with something more friendly to use as a future app.
  
  As soon as possible I gonna be writing an article talking about specially of the mediapipe!

**Background in:** Python with OpenCV, Mediapipe, Pandas and Numpy
